  Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Luan Albert
</h1>
<p>

Passionate about technology, programming student, good music lover, and good series.

I started in the programming area in 2018 ("it's true it's a short time"), but in that "short time" I learned a lot that until then I thought was impossible to learn, and now I run to improve this knowledge.

In order to become a qualified FullStack developer, I make studies a priority in my life, and I always like to be involved in some project because I believe that practice is the best way to learn.
</p>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Home
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, NodeJS and SQLServer
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with projects that offer opportunity to beginners, so you can learn on the job.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
